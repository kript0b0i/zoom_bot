# zoom_bot
* Zoom bot 
* python 3.8.0
* What we should do
* Road Map
* Which task who does
* Go over code base

## What features do you want: 
* Making an executable. Might be issued with permission. The benefits are: no python is needed, regular people can download and use. (Pablo can look into it)
Not everyone uses a zoom native client. I use the web client. There is a tool called selenium
Google Meet(), Skype. 
* Landing page. It can have the files or the executable. (it can have instructions)
* Setup a python Linter
* Travis CI
* Record audio
* Play video to zoom client
* Synthesize voice

Road map
Concurrent task:<br>
### Hassan<br>
Hassan would fork the current repo<br> ✅
* Make a Travis CI account. <br>✅
* Setup a Travis Yaml file in the repo<br>✅
* Make it run some trivial unit test(check that print(‘hello world’) prints out hello world or something * like that. ) in a separate file from luis’s files (test.py)<br>

* Hassan if he has extra time can add a linter.  The PEP 8 standard is decent.
* Make sure to make the linter ignore the files luis worked on since those would throw a lot of errors.
* Make sure that your linter runs on the test.py file you create
### Luis
* Fix bugs by selecting option 1 on an empty db, and then selecting option 2.
* Setup way to record audio.<br>
* Play certain audio<br>
